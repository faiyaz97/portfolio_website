    <b>My report:</b><a href="report.html">http://doc.gold.ac.uk/~ffaiy001/webdev/course-work/report.html</a>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        The website that I created is about me and my life. It contains my biography, cv and projects which I have done during the last years. These pages are linked through a navigation bar so that the user can go through all the pages easily. More specifically it is a simple hierarchical structure and it is a personal website. 
    </p>
    <h3>Ispiration</h3>
    <p>
        I took much inspirations from the internet and I found a  template at the following website [1]; I tried to recreate it but on my own style. Besides this site I got inspired by many youtubers who are developers e.g. “Quentin Watt Tutorials”, “DevTips”. 
        During the creation of my website what inspired me had been also the social media’s and Wikipedia styles for my biography.   
    </p>
    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <p>
        My site can be considered accessible because the colour of the text does not blend with the background hence the text stays clear and legible. Even the font size makes the reading easy to anyone. The colours chosen for the website are not too intense nor dull so that the user of the website  do not have problems to visit and navigate through the website.
    </p>
    <h3>Usability</h3>
    <p>
        My website takes account of usability: mobile responsiveness is one of the feature that makes my website adaptable in different screen sizes. Simplicity is another element that enhance usability in my site. Finally my website takes in consideration of learnability as through this any user can learn about myself, indeed. 
    </p>
    <h3>Learning/Finding Development Process</h3>
    <p>
        Making a website require a lot of creativity and knowledge which you need to develop also by yourself. That is what happened while I was creating mine. One of the things that I have learned is to make side by side div at the same height following w3schools’ website. [2]
        The “formspree” website made easier my work to create a form that makes possible to send message to my email address and I added a javascript code wrote by me to check that the input boxes are filed properly.[3] 
        One thing I learned when I was creating my site is the responsive navigation bar. When the site is accessed from a mobile device the bar disappears and a button shows up instead and when the user presses it  the navigation bar appears in horizontal.
    </p>
    <h3>Positive Aspects</h3>
    <p>   
        In my opinion one of the best aspect of my work is the navigation bar because it is simple and efficient as it works very well in all devices’ resolutions. The site is easy to navigate and the user can go through the desired section.
        The site graphic is also really simple and professional, this does not complicate the information displayed.
        I added also the "go to top" button in "biography", "projects" and "cv" pages when the page scrolled is greater than 20px. It helps you to go back to the top in a easy way. I applied this button to these pages because their height is greater.
    </p>
    <h3>Aspects To Improve</h3>
    <p>
        What can be improved in my work is the organisation of the images: I could have taken more care about the sizes and positions of the images and the texts. Next time I need to take into account even little details like these.
        Need to improve my CV page which is only text and is not really nice to see.
